## High performance BVS

The software in this repository efficiently implements a subset of the Bayesian Variable Selection (BVS) techniques generally referred to as Spike-and-Slab regression.

More specifically:

* Dirac_SS_IP implements Dirac Spike-and-Slab regression with the independent prior.

* Dirac_SS_gP implements Dirac Spike-and-Slab regression with the g-prior.

Estimation relies on Gibbs sampling.

For a review of the topic, refer to:

The software is written in C++ for performance, and is meant for usage in R via [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) and [RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html).

This project is ongoing. Contributions are welcome.
